## Transcription
Tactical casualty assessment: Male patient, approximately 30 years old with multiple injuries.
Massive hemorrhage observed in the left lower extremity, appears to be arterial bleeding.
Airways are currently patent but at risk due to facial injuries.
Breathing is labored at 24 respirations per minute with decreased breath sounds on the right side.
Circulation compromised with weak radial pulse at 128 bpm, blood pressure estimated at 90/60.
Patient is responsive to verbal stimuli but disoriented. GCS estimated at 13 (E3 V4 M6).
Casualty requires immediate MEDEVAC with tourniquet applied to left lower extremity,
followed by needle decompression for suspected tension pneumothorax.

## Medical Terms Identified
- Massive hemorrhage
- Arterial bleeding
- Patent airways
- Respiratory rate: 24/min
- Decreased breath sounds
- Radial pulse: 128 bpm
- Blood pressure: 90/60
- Glasgow Coma Scale: 13 (E3 V4 M6)
- Tourniquet
- Needle decompression
- Tension pneumothorax

## MARCH Assessment
- M: Massive hemorrhage identified in left lower extremity, requires immediate control
- A: Airways currently patent but at risk due to facial trauma
- R: Respiratory distress with potential tension pneumothorax
- C: Compromised circulation with tachycardia and hypotension
- H: Hypothermia risk not assessed, environment dependent

## Evacuation Priority
URGENT: Casualty requires evacuation within 1 hour due to life-threatening injuries
Estimated survival probability: 85% with immediate interventions

## Recommended Actions
1. Apply tourniquet to left lower extremity
2. Perform needle decompression right chest
3. Establish IV access and begin fluid resuscitation
4. Administer TXA if evacuation time > 15 minutes
5. Monitor for airway compromise
6. Request MEDEVAC with surgical capability
