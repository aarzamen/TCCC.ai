# TCCC Testing Summary

## Test Environment Summary
**Date:** March 21, 2025  
**Hardware:** 
- Razer Seiren V3 Mini microphone (device 0)
- DisplayPort monitor (1560x720)
- HDMI audio output

## Audio Environment Assessment
The testing environment has the following characteristics:
- Consistent background fan noise
- Some TV conversation in background
- Alliance hum (low frequency noise)
- The noise profile shows dominant frequencies in the bass range
- Estimated SNR: Low to moderate (0-10 dB)

## Hardware Verification Results
- ✅ **Razer Microphone**: Successfully detected and functional
- ✅ **DisplayPort Monitor**: Successfully detected (as alternative to HDMI)
- ✅ **Audio Output**: HDMI audio output functioning correctly

## Speech Recognition Challenges
During testing, we encountered the following challenges:
1. ONNX model conversion issues preventing optimal model loading
2. Low signal-to-noise ratio affecting transcription quality
3. PyTorch compatibility issues with some advanced features (speaker diarization)
4. Difficulty recognizing specialized medical terminology

## Recommendations for Optimal Performance

### Audio Processing Optimization
- **Noise Gate Threshold:** 0.011
- **Highpass Filter Cutoff:** 120 Hz (to reduce low-frequency background noise)
- **Compression Ratio:** 4.0
- **Compression Threshold:** -18 dB
- **Noise Reduction Amount:** High

### Speech Input Recommendations
- Position microphone closer to the mouth (6-8 inches)
- Speak at a consistent, moderate volume
- Clearly articulate medical terminology and abbreviations
- Use standardized communication patterns (MARCHE, 9-liner format) consistently

### System Configuration
- Use the dedicated configuration script: `./setup_hardware_config.sh`
- Launch the system with: `./launch_tccc_mvp.sh`
- Verify hardware setup before each session: `./test_hardware_setup.py`

### Future Enhancements
- Create a custom medical terminology language model for better recognition
- Implement a more robust signal preprocessing pipeline for the specific background noise pattern
- Train the system on recorded TCCC assessments for improved context understanding
- Add fall-back mechanisms when transcription confidence is low

## Successful Integration Points
Despite the challenges, the following integrations were successful:
- Audio hardware detection and configuration
- Basic audio capture and playback
- Event system communication between components
- System initialization and shutdown sequence
- Hardware configuration management

## Next Steps
1. Implement the audio processing optimizations
2. Conduct further testing with the optimized audio pipeline
3. Create a specialized medical terminology processor
4. Deploy and test on the target Jetson hardware

The TCCC system has reached MVP status with verified hardware integration, though additional work is needed to optimize speech recognition performance in the current acoustic environment.
