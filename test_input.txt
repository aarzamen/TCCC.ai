The patient has a gunshot wound to the right leg with significant bleeding. I'm applying a tourniquet above the wound site to control hemorrhage. Hemorrhage is now controlled. Moving on to airway assessment. Patient's airway is clear. Breathing is rapid but adequate. Vital signs are: BP 110/70, pulse 120, respiratory rate 22. The patient needs immediate evacuation to a surgical facility. We've administered 10mg of morphine IV for pain control and started IV fluids. Patient is conscious and alert with a GCS of 15.
