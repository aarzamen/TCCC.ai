# Treatment Protocol for Tension Pneumothorax

## Identification
Signs and symptoms of tension pneumothorax:
1. Severe respiratory distress
2. Absent or decreased breath sounds on affected side
3. Hypotension
4. Tracheal deviation away from affected side
5. Distended neck veins
6. Increased respiratory difficulty after penetrating or blunt chest trauma
7. Chest pain and air hunger

## Treatment Procedure
For suspected tension pneumothorax in tactical field care:

1. Expose the chest and identify the decompression site:
   - 2nd intercostal space at the midclavicular line (traditional approach)
   - 5th intercostal space at the anterior axillary line (preferred in TCCC)

2. Prepare the site:
   - Clean the site with antiseptic if available
   - Not critical in life-threatening situations

3. Perform needle decompression:
   - Use a 14-gauge, 3.25-inch (8cm) needle/catheter
   - Insert the needle perpendicular to the chest wall, just above the rib
   - Advance until you feel a "pop" and hear rush of air
   - Remove the needle but leave the catheter in place
   - Secure the catheter with tape

4. Assess effectiveness:
   - Look for improved respiratory status
   - Monitor for return of breath sounds
   - Watch for improved hemodynamic status (blood pressure, pulse)

5. Apply a one-way valve:
   - Commercial chest seal with valve
   - Improvised valve using finger of glove if necessary

6. Prepare for potential repeat decompression:
   - Tension pneumothorax may recur
   - Be prepared to repeat the procedure if symptoms return

7. Evacuate as soon as possible:
   - Needle decompression is a temporary measure
   - Definitive treatment requires chest tube placement at higher level of care

## Special Considerations
- If available, ultrasound can confirm diagnosis
- Document procedure on TCCC card, including time performed
- A successfully treated tension pneumothorax is a critical evacuation priority
- In prolonged field care situations, consider placing a chest tube if trained to do so
