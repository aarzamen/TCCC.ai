# Common Medical Procedures in TCCC

## Airway Management
Proper airway management is critical in tactical care. The following procedures may be necessary:

1. Chin Lift/Jaw Thrust: Basic maneuver to open airway
2. Nasopharyngeal Airway (NPA): Used for unconscious patients with intact gag reflex
3. Supraglottic Airway Device: Used when NPA is insufficient
4. Surgical Cricothyroidotomy: Used when other methods fail

## Breathing Support
Ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation:

1. Needle Decompression: For tension pneumothorax
2. Chest Seal: For open pneumothorax
3. Oxygen Administration: When available
4. Assisted Ventilation: When breathing is inadequate

## Circulation Management
Control bleeding and maintain circulation:

1. Direct Pressure: First-line treatment for hemorrhage
2. Tourniquet Application: For life-threatening extremity bleeding
3. Hemostatic Dressings: For wounds not amenable to tourniquet
4. IV/IO Access: For fluid and medication administration
5. Fluid Resuscitation: For hypovolemic shock
