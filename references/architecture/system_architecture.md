## Key Data Flows

### 1. Audio Capture to Transcription
1. Audio Pipeline captures raw audio from telephony system
2. Audio is processed for quality enhancement
3. Processed audio is streamed to STT Engine
4. STT Engine converts audio to text in real-time
5. Transcription segments are delivered to Processing Core
6. Full transcription is stored in Data Store

### 2. Transcription to Insights
1. Processing Core receives transcription segments
2. Entities, intents, and sentiment are extracted
3. Conversation context is updated with new insights
4. Summarization is performed on conversation segments
5. Insights are passed to LLM Analysis Engine
6. Analysis results are stored in Data Store

### 3. Insights to Recommendations
1. LLM Analysis Engine receives conversation insights
2. Context is augmented with relevant documents from Document Library
3. Agent recommendations are generated based on context
4. Compliance checks are performed on conversation
5. Next-best-actions are suggested to agent
6. Recommendations are presented through User Interface

### 4. Feedback Loop
1. Agent actions in response to recommendations are captured
2. System effectiveness metrics are calculated
3. Performance data is stored for analysis
4. Models and recommendations are improved based on feedback
5. System parameters are adjusted for better performance
