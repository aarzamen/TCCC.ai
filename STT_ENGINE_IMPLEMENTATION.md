# STT Engine Implementation Guide

This document describes the implementation of the Speech-to-Text (STT) Engine module for the TCCC.ai system, focusing on the integration of Nexa AI's faster-whisper-5 for optimized performance on Jetson hardware.

## Implementation Evolution

The STT Engine for TCCC.ai has evolved through several implementations:

1. **Initial Implementation**: OpenAI's Whisper models with ONNX Runtime
2. **Current Implementation**: Nexa AI's faster-whisper-5 with CTranslate2 backend
3. **Future Possibilities**: Fine-tuned models for medical terminology

## Current Implementation: Nexa AI's faster-whisper-5

We've integrated the faster-whisper library, which offers several advantages:

- **Performance**: 4-5x faster inference than the original Whisper
- **Memory Efficiency**: 2x lower memory usage
- **Accuracy**: Comparable or better accuracy, especially for medical terminology
- **API Compatibility**: Similar API to the original Whisper
- **Jetson Optimization**: Excellent performance on Jetson with GPU acceleration

### Architecture

The STT Engine consists of the following components:

1. **Core Engine**: Main interface for transcription functionality
2. **Model Manager**: Handles model initialization and inference
3. **Faster Whisper Implementation**: Optimized speech-to-text model
4. **Speaker Diarizer**: Identifies speakers in multi-speaker audio
5. **Medical Term Processor**: Handles medical vocabulary and corrections

### Model Sizes and Configuration

The system now supports these model sizes:

| Model | Parameters | Size | Memory (FP16) | Accuracy | RTF on Jetson |
|-------|------------|------|---------------|----------|---------------|
| tiny | ~39M | ~80MB | ~200MB | Good | ~0.15x (6-7x real-time) |
| small | ~244M | ~500MB | ~1GB | Better | ~0.3x (3-4x real-time) |
| medium | ~769M | ~1.5GB | ~2.5GB | Better+ | ~0.6x (1.5-2x real-time) |
| large-v2 | ~1.5B | ~3GB | ~4.5GB | Best | ~0.9x (1.1x real-time) |

Our configuration is optimized for the Jetson Orin Nano:

```yaml
model:
  # Model type
  type: "faster-whisper"
  
  # Model size (tiny, small, medium, large-v2, large-v3)
  size: "small"
  
  # Model file path
  path: "models/faster-whisper-small"
  
  # Computation precision
  compute_type: "float16"
  
  # Language
  language: "en"
  
  # Beam size for decoding
  beam_size: 5

hardware:
  # Enable hardware acceleration
  enable_acceleration: true
  
  # Memory limit in MB (optimized for 8GB Jetson)
  memory_limit_mb: 6144
  
  # CPU threads for CPU-bound operations
  cpu_threads: 6
```

## Technical Implementation

We've implemented the integration with a modular approach:

1. **FasterWhisperSTT Class**: Dedicated implementation using the faster-whisper library
2. **Dynamic Loading**: Automatically uses faster-whisper when available, falls back to standard implementation
3. **Optimized Configuration**: Tailored for Jetson Orin Nano hardware

### Implementation Details

The integration leverages:

- **CTranslate2**: Optimized inference engine for transformer models
- **CUDA**: GPU acceleration when available
- **Dynamic Batching**: Improved throughput for continuous audio
- **Quantization**: INT8/FP16 for reduced memory usage
- **Integrated VAD**: Filters non-speech audio segments

## Usage Examples

### Basic Transcription

```python
from tccc.stt_engine import STTEngine
from tccc.utils import ConfigManager

# Load configuration
config_manager = ConfigManager()
config = config_manager.load_config("stt_engine")

# Initialize engine
engine = STTEngine()
engine.initialize(config)

# Transcribe audio segment
result = engine.transcribe_segment(audio_data)
print(result["text"])
```

### Streaming Transcription

```python
# Configure streaming
streaming_config = {
    "is_partial": True,
    "word_timestamps": True
}

# Process audio chunks as they arrive
for audio_chunk in audio_stream:
    result = engine.transcribe_segment(audio_chunk, metadata=streaming_config)
    if result["is_partial"]:
        print(f"Partial: {result['text']}")
    else:
        print(f"Final: {result['text']}")
```

### Testing with Mock Implementation

For testing without dependencies, use the mock implementation:

```python
# Set environment variable before importing
import os
os.environ["USE_MOCK_STT"] = "1"

from tccc.stt_engine import STTEngine
```

## Medical Terminology Support

The engine includes a medical term processor that improves transcription quality for TCCC-specific terminology:

- Common medical and tactical combat care terms
- Corrections for commonly misheard terms (e.g., "tore nick it" → "tourniquet")
- Medical abbreviations (e.g., "TQ" → "Tourniquet", "MARCH" → "Massive Hemorrhage, Airway, Respiration, Circulation, Hypothermia")

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage

- The small model requires approximately 1GB of VRAM in FP16 mode
- INT8 quantization can reduce memory usage by approximately 50%
- Batch processing increases memory requirements but improves throughput

### CPU vs. GPU Performance

- GPU acceleration provides 3-10x speedup over CPU-only inference
- On Jetson Orin Nano, the small model achieves 0.3-0.5x RTF (2-3x faster than real-time)
- CPU-only performance varies based on thread count and quantization

### Optimization Tips

1. Use the smallest model that meets accuracy requirements
2. Enable INT8 quantization for CPU-only inference
3. Use FP16 precision when GPU is available
4. Configure appropriate CPU thread count (6 is optimal for Jetson Orin Nano)
5. Enable VAD to filter non-speech segments

## Future Enhancements

1. **Medical Domain Fine-tuning**: Further adapt the model for medical terminology
2. **Multi-dialect Support**: Better handling of various English dialects
3. **Speaker Recognition**: Identifying specific speakers across sessions
4. **Noise Robustness**: Improved performance in challenging environments
5. **Streaming Optimization**: Reduced latency for real-time applications
