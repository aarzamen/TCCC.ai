# LLM Analysis Module Implementation

This document outlines the implementation details for the LLM Analysis module in the TCCC.ai system, which uses Microsoft's Phi-2 model optimized for deployment on Jetson hardware.

## Overview

The LLM Analysis module extracts medical information from transcribed conversations and generates structured reports using natural language processing. It is designed to run efficiently on edge hardware with or without the actual model files.

## Architecture

The module implements a multi-tier architecture:

1. **Interface Layer**: `LLMAnalysis` main class providing API endpoints
2. **Engine Layer**: `LLMEngine` managing model loading and inference
3. **Analysis Layer**: Specialized extractors and generators for medical data
4. **Mock Layer**: Provides simulation capabilities for development and testing

## Key Components

### 1. LLM Engine

The LLM Engine handles model loading, hardware optimization, and text generation:

- Supports multiple model types with a common interface
- Implements hardware acceleration for Jetson platforms
- Provides automatic fallback mechanisms
- Handles memory constraints through quantization

### 2. Medical Entity Extractor

The Medical Entity Extractor processes transcriptions and extracts structured information:

- Entity identification (procedures, medications, vitals)
- Temporal information extraction
- Classification of medical events

### 3. Report Generator

The Report Generator creates standardized medical reports from extracted entities:

- MEDEVAC requests
- ZMIST trauma reports
- SOAP notes
- TCCC cards

### 4. Mock Implementation

The mock implementation provides development and testing capabilities without requiring the actual model:

- Pre-defined responses for different medical scenarios
- Realistic latency simulation
- Metrics tracking similar to the real model
- Automatic fallback when model files unavailable

## Phi-2 Model Integration

The module integrates Microsoft's Phi-2 model (2.7B parameters) for optimal performance on edge devices:

### Technical Specifications

- **Model Size**: 2.7B parameters
- **Context Length**: 2048 tokens
- **Quantization Options**: FP16, INT8, INT4
- **Format**: ONNX with TensorRT acceleration
- **Memory Usage**: ~1.3GB (INT4) to ~5GB (FP16)

### Integration Methods

Two integration approaches are supported:

1. **Direct Integration**: Using the Hugging Face transformers library with ONNX Runtime
2. **Mock Integration**: Using predefined responses for development and testing

The system automatically selects the appropriate implementation based on:
- Available model files
- Environment configuration
- Hardware capabilities

### Configuration

The model is configured in `config/llm_analysis.yaml`:

```yaml
model:
  primary:
    provider: "local"
    name: "phi-2-instruct"
    path: "models/phi-2-instruct/"
    
hardware:
  enable_acceleration: true
  cuda_device: 0
  quantization: "4-bit"
```

## Mock Implementation Details

The mock implementation provides realistic responses without requiring the actual model:

- Pre-defined responses for different medical scenarios
- Simulated latency based on input complexity
- Matching API surface with the real model
- Automatic switching based on environment variables

### Enabling Mock Mode

Set environment variable to force mock usage:
```bash
export TCCC_USE_MOCK_LLM=1
```

## Performance Optimization

The module includes several optimizations for edge deployment:

1. **Quantization**: INT4/INT8 options for memory efficiency
2. **ONNX Runtime**: Hardware-specific optimizations
3. **TensorRT Integration**: Acceleration for Jetson platforms
4. **Caching**: Response caching to reduce redundant computation
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Automatic fallback to simpler models

## Testing and Verification

Verification can be performed using:

```bash
python verification_script_llm_analysis.py
```

The verification script:
- Tests model loading and inference
- Validates entity extraction
- Confirms report generation
- Measures performance metrics

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:

1. Support for newer models like Phi-3 and NVIDIA Nexa
2. Domain-specific fine-tuning for medical terminology
3. Sparse attention mechanisms for longer context windows
4. Knowledge graph integration for medical entity disambiguation
5. Improved quantization techniques for better efficiency
