# RAG System Improvements for TCCC.ai

## Overview
We have implemented a series of improvements to the TCCC.ai RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to address context length issues, enhance robustness, and add error handling for dependency failures.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Adaptive Context Sizing
- Added `adaptive_context_sizing` feature to dynamically adjust context size based on template requirements
- Implemented automatic template overhead calculation to maximize usable context
- Created two-step prompt generation with fallback to smaller context when needed
- Added metadata for users to understand what context was included/excluded

### 2. Context Length Management
- Added a configurable `max_context_length` parameter with proper API
- Implemented context length restoration after temporary changes
- Created fallback mechanisms for when contexts exceed limits
- Built cascading error handling for robust prompt generation under constraints

### 3. Context Prioritization
- Implemented the `ContextIntegrator` class to handle context integration with LLM
- Added per-event budgeting system for critical medical information
- Created event prioritization logic to ensure important details get full context
- Added context tracking to monitor and optimize context usage

### 4. Dependency Handling
- Added conditional imports and mock implementations to handle missing ML dependencies
- Created fallback behaviors for when vector search is unavailable
- Implemented proxy patterns to avoid breaking the API when components are missing
- Improved logging for dependency-related issues

### 5. Testing Framework
- Created a specialized verification script for testing RAG functionality
- Added tests for different context length scenarios (500, 1000, 1500, 2000 chars)
- Implemented end-to-end testing of the full RAG pipeline
- Added specific tests for medical vocabulary extraction

## Impact
These improvements enable TCCC.ai to handle documents of any size while maintaining optimal context usage in LLM prompts. The system now degrades gracefully when faced with constraints rather than failing outright.

## Next Steps
1. Further refinement of context prioritization heuristics for medical terms
2. Optimization of embedding model size for edge deployment
3. Enhanced caching strategies for improved performance
4. Additional error recovery mechanisms for edge cases
