# TCCC.ai Next Steps

This document outlines the next steps for the TCCC.ai project, focusing on resolving critical issues and improving system integration.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Async/Sync Interface Mismatches** âœ…
   - Added unified approach to handle both sync and async functions
   - Created proper async interfaces in module_adapter.py
   - Redesigned audio processing thread to use dedicated async event loop
   - Added utilities to automatically wrap sync methods in async-compatible functions
   - Verification script completed successfully: `verification_script_async_modules.py`

2. **Audio Pipeline Data Type Mismatches** âœ…
   - Created `audio_data_converter.py` for standardized audio format conversions
   - Implemented robust type checking and format conversion
   - Enhanced `StreamBuffer` to handle different audio formats consistently
   - Created and verified data type handling with `verification_script_audio_data_format.py`

3. **Chunk Size Inconsistencies** âœ…
   - Developed `audio_chunk_manager.py` with three primary classes:
     - `AudioChunkBuffer`: Accumulates small chunks into larger ones with optional overlap
     - `ChunkSizeAdapter`: Converts between different chunk sizes bidirectionally
     - `AudioChunkProcessor`: Handles the entire chunk processing pipeline with configurable sizes
   - Updated audio pipeline configuration to explicitly specify chunk sizes
   - Added standard chunk size constants for different processing requirements
   - Created and verified functionality with `verification_script_audio_chunk_management.py`

## Current Issues (Priority Order)

1. **VAD Improper Sharing** ðŸ”´
   - Problem: Voice Activity Detector shared inappropriately between components
   - Impact: Concurrent access causing race conditions and missed speech segments
   - Proposed Solution:
     - Create dedicated VAD instances for each component
     - Implement consistent VAD state propagation through events
     - Provide shared VAD results rather than shared VAD objects

2. **Resource Allocation for Jetson Hardware** ðŸ”´
   - Problem: Memory and compute resources not properly managed for Jetson
   - Impact: System crashes or severe performance degradation under load
   - Proposed Solution:
     - Implement dynamic model loading/unloading mechanism
     - Create resource monitoring and allocation system
     - Add configurable processing tiers based on available resources

3. **Form Extraction Logic Issues** ðŸŸ 
   - Problem: TCCC form extraction logic inconsistent with medical standards
   - Impact: Generated forms may omit critical information
   - Proposed Solution:
     - Refine entity extraction logic for medical procedures
     - Ensure all required DD Form 1380 fields are correctly populated
     - Improve timeline event correlation with medical actions

4. **RAG Processing Delays** ðŸŸ 
   - Problem: Document retrieval creating bottlenecks in processing
   - Impact: Long delays when retrieving relevant medical information
   - Proposed Solution:
     - Implement query caching mechanism
     - Optimize vector search for Jetson hardware
     - Add adaptive retrieval depth based on query complexity

5. **Display Formatting Issues** ðŸŸ¡
   - Problem: Text layout inconsistent on WaveShare display
   - Impact: Difficult readability in field conditions
   - Proposed Solution:
     - Create standardized display templates
     - Implement adaptive font sizing based on content
     - Optimize UI for outdoor visibility

## Implementation Plan

### Next Immediate Tasks

1. **VAD Sharing Fix**
   - Create `vad_manager.py` with dedicated VAD provider class
   - Refactor `audio_pipeline.py` to use VAD manager
   - Add VAD result events with standardized schema
   - Create verification script for VAD functionality

2. **Resource Management Implementation**
   - Enhance `resource_monitor.py` with Jetson-specific profiling
   - Create dynamic model loading manager in `processing_core.py`
   - Implement resource allocation strategy based on component priority
   - Add memory usage monitoring and logging

### Timeline

1. Week 1: Complete VAD sharing fix and verification
2. Week 2: Implement resource allocation system
3. Week 3: Address form extraction logic
4. Week 4: Optimize RAG processing
5. Week 5: Fix display formatting and create system-wide verification

## Testing Strategy

For each component fix:

1. Create dedicated verification script
2. Test in isolation with controlled inputs
3. Test integration with adjacent components
4. Perform system-wide verification
5. Run on actual Jetson hardware under load

## Measuring Success

- All verification scripts pass consistently
- System operates without crashes for >12 hours
- Speech recognition accuracy >90% in field conditions
- End-to-end processing time <5 seconds for standard queries
- Memory usage remains below 80% during operation

## Documentation Updates

- Update README.md with latest component status
- Create usage guides for new features
- Document configuration options for different deployment scenarios
- Update architecture diagrams to reflect new component relationships
