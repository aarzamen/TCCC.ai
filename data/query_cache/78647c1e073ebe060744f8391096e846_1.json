Chin Lift/Jaw Thrust: Basic maneuver to open airway 2. Nasopharyngeal Airway (NPA): Used for unconscious patients with intact gag reflex 3. Supraglottic Airway Device: Used when NPA is insufficient 4. Surgical Cricothyroidotomy: Used when other methods fail ## Breathing Support Ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation: 1. Needle Decompression: For tension pneumothorax 2. Chest Seal: For open pneumothorax 3. Oxygen Administration: When available 4. Assisted Ventilation: When breathing is inadequate ## Circulation Management Control bleeding and maintain circulation: 1. Direct Pressure: First-line treatment for hemorrhage 2. Tourniquet Application: For life-threatening extremity bleeding 3. Hemostatic Dressings: For wounds not amenable to tourniquet 4. IV/IO Access: For fluid and medication administration 5.
