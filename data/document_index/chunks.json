Increased respiratory difficulty after penetrating or blunt chest trauma 7. Chest pain and air hunger ## Treatment Procedure For suspected tension pneumothorax in tactical field care: 1. Expose the chest and identify the decompression site: - 2nd intercostal space at the midclavicular line (traditional approach) - 5th intercostal space at the anterior axillary line (preferred in TCCC) 2. Prepare the site: - Clean the site with antiseptic if available - Not critical in life-threatening situations 3. Perform needle decompression: - Use a 14-gauge, 3.25-inch (8cm) needle/catheter - Insert the needle perpendicular to the chest wall, just above the rib - Advance until you feel a \"pop\" and hear rush of air - Remove ",

Assess effectiveness: - Look for improved respiratory status - Monitor for return of breath sounds - Watch for improved hemodynamic status (blood pressure, pulse) 5. Apply a one-way valve: - Commercial chest seal with valve - Improvised valve using finger of glove if necessary 6. Prepare for potential repeat decompression: - Tension pneumothorax may recur - Be prepared to repeat the procedure if symptoms return 7.

HISTORY OF TCCC a. It is important to realize that civilian trauma care in a non-tactical setting is dissimilar to trauma care in a combat environment. TCCC and CLS are an attempt to better prepare medical and non-medical personnel for the unique factors associated with combat trauma casualties. b. Historical data shows that 90% of combat wound fatalities die on the battlefield before reaching a military treatment facility. This fact illustrates the importance of first responder care at the point of injury. c.

The TCCC guidelines are currently endorsed by the American College of Surgeons, Committee on Trauma and the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians. The guidelines have been incorporated into the Prehospital Trauma Life Support (PHTLS) text since the 4th edition. g. The Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care (CoTCCC) was established in 2002 by the US Special Operations Command with support from the US Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED).

THE MUSCLE/SKELETAL SYSTEM (1) The skeleton is the bony framework of the body and is composed of 206 bones. It supports and gives shape to the body; protects vital organs; and provides sites of attachment for tendons, muscles, and ligaments. The skeletal bones are joined members that make muscle movement possible. (See Figure-1) (2) Axial Skeleton - The axial skeleton consists of the skull, spinal column and rib cage. (3) Appendicular Skeleton - The appendicular skeleton consists of the bones of the upper extremities which include the scapula, bones of the lower extremities, and the pelvic girdle. (a) The upper extremities are made up of the humerus, ulna, radius and bones of the wrist & hand. (b) The lower extremities are made up of the femur, tibia, fibula, patella and bones that make up the ankles & feet. 11\\nFigure \u2013",

The action of the muscle is determined mainly by the kind of joint it is associated with and the way the muscle is attached to the joint. Muscle seldom act alone, they usually working in groups to provide movement. 2. VITAL BODY FUNCTIONS Overview - In order for the service member to learn to perform first aid procedures, he must have a basic understanding of what the vital body functions are and what the result will be if they are damaged or not functioning. a.

(2) Voice - the patient makes some kind of response when you talk to them, which could be in any of the three component measures of Eyes, Voice or Motor. (e.g. patient's eyes open on being asked \"are you 12\\nokay?\"). The response could be as little as a grunt, moan, or slight move of a limb when prompted by the voice of the CLS. (3) Pain - the casualty makes a response on any of the three component measures when pain stimulus is used on them.

(b) Brachial pinch \u2013 here the CLS pinches the Brachial area of the causality to stimulate pain. (4) Unresponsive - this outcome is recorded if the casualty does not give any Eye, Voice or Motor response to voice or pain. b. Breathing Process. All humans must have oxygen to live. Through the breathing process, the lungs draw oxygen from the air and put it into the blood. The heart pumps the blood through the body to be used by the cells that require a constant supply of oxygen. Some cells are more dependent on a constant supply of oxygen than others.

Respiration occurs when a person inhales (oxygen is taken into the body) and then exhales (carbon dioxide [CO2] is expelled from the body). Respiration involves the airway, the lungs, and diaphragm. (See Figure-2) (1) Airway. The airway consists of the nose, mouth, throat, voice box, and windpipe. It is the canal through which air passes to and from the lungs. 13\\n(2) Lungs.

The normal breathing rate is about 12 to 20 breaths per minute. (b) Respiration rhythm refers to the manner in which a person breathes. Respiration rhythm is classified as regular or irregular. A regular rhythm is when the interval between breaths is constant, and an irregular rhythm is when the interval between breaths varies. (c) Respiration depth refers to the amount of air moved between each breath. Respiration depth is classified as normal, deep, or shallow. Figure \u2013 2 Respiratory System d. Blood Circulation.

Extremity hemorrhage is the most frequent cause of PREVENTABLE deaths on the battlefield. These wounds may be fatal within minutes. In a combat environment, the treatment of a life-threatening hemorrhage is the first priority. This is because the brain can go 4 to 6 minutes without oxygen before permanent brain damage occurs. Once hemorrhage is controlled, the establishment of the airway once again becomes the primary concern AFTER the casualty has been moved to a safer setting, as in the Tactical Field Care phase of TCCC. 1.

(5) The diaphragm and rib muscles, which are under the control of the respiratory center in the brain, automatically contract and relax. Contraction increases and relaxation decreases the size of the rib cage. When the rib cage increases and then decreases, the air pressure in the lungs is first less and then more than the atmospheric pressure, thus causing the air to rush into and out of the lungs to equalize the pressure.

The initial diagnosis of shock is based upon the presence of inadequate organ perfusion and tissue oxygenation. The initial step for managing shock in the injured patient is to recognize its presence. 1. MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY The following terminology is important to understanding the function of the cardiovascular system. a. Estimated Blood Pressure \u2013 blood pressure can be estimated based on the presence of a casualty\u2019s heart rate. Below are the parameters for estimating blood pressure: (1) Radial Pulses = 80/P (2) Femoral Pulses = 70/P (3) Carotid Pulses = 60/P b.

ANATOMY OF THE SKIN: a. The most important function is to form a protective barrier against the external environment. b. The skin also prevents fluid loss, helps regulate body temperature, and allows for sensation. c. Skin is composed of three layers: the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue. (See figure-1) (1) The epidermis, which is the outermost layer, is made up entirely of skin cells with no blood vessels (2) Underlying the epidermis is the thicker dermis, made up of a framework of connective tissues containing blood vessels, nerve endings, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands.

Burn injuries have many causes on and off the battlefield. Burns are caused by exposure to extreme heat, a biologic reaction from chemicals, or energy transfer through cells from electrocution or radiation. Many weapons and munitions cause burn injuries. Some, such as incendiary and flame munitions, are designed to cause high heat and burning. Others, such as high explosives, bombs, and mines cause burns secondarily to their primary effect. The four primary causes of burns are thermal, electrical, chemical, and radiant. b. Thermal Burns: Thermal burns are the most common type of burn on the modern battlefield. The",

Thermal Burns: Thermal burns are the most common type of burn on the modern battlefield. They can result from exposure to flame weapons, incendiary weapons, munitions, IED\u2019s or from explosions from fuel sources (gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel). These weapons are designed to burn at very high temperatures and incorporate napalm, thermite, magnesium, and white phosphorous. The primary effect of incendiary and flame munitions against personnel is to cause severe burns. Due to the high burning temperature of these weapons, airway compromise must be considered. (1) Napalm - Burning temperature of 1400-2100 degrees Fahrenheit. Its design and employment against personnel will result in many more burns than other devices. (2) Thermite - Burning temperature of 3600-5400\u00b0 degrees Fahrenheit, can melt through steel armor. (3) Magnesium - Burning temperature of 5400\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Hottest burn",

Hottest burn and can rapidly melt through steel armor. 66\\n(4) White Phosphorous (WP or Willy Pete) - Burning temperature of 1500\u00b0 Fahrenheit. This deserves special mention because it combusts with air and continues to burn until the oxygen source is removed. The casualty may be showered with WP fragments from a near-by explosion, which may become embedded in their skin. c. Electrical - Electrical burns may be far more serious than a preliminary examination may indicate. The entrance and exit wounds may be small, but as electricity penetrates the skin, it burns a large area below the surface along the path it travels through the body.

BATTLEFIELD ANTIBIOTICS a. Overview \u2013 The use of antibiotics on the battlefield has shown to be a huge improvement to the quality of care of our casualties. In Mogadishu in 1993, there were 58 casualties; 16 in which developed wound infections. The infection rate was at 28%. Another study showed that 32 casualties sustained open wounds. ALL of the casualties received battlefield antibiotics. The outcome resulted in NONE developing infection. 86\\nb. Antibiotics (1) Recommended for all open wounds sustained on the battlefield.

Triage is based on a casualty\u2019s need for immediate medical treatment and establishes the order for treatment and movement. It is a continuous, on-going process and does not stop after your initial assessment. Triage will ensure the greatest care for the greatest number of casualties and will also maximize personnel and resources. 1. TRIAGE CATEGORIES a.

Very few military physicians, however, have had training in this area. As a result, at the onset of hostilities, most combat Medics, corpsmen, and para-rescue personnel (PJs) in the US Military were trained to perform battlefield trauma care through the use of civilian-based trauma courses that were not designed for the prehospital combat environment and did not reflect contemporary knowledge in this area. This challenge was met by the Committee on TCCC (CoTCCC) voting members and its many liaison members that collectively comprise the TCCC Working Group.

(8404- MED-2010d) 4-1\\nOVERVIEW Pre-hospital trauma care on the battlefield differs greatly than pre-hospital trauma care practiced in the private sector. The types and severity of injuries are different than those encountered in civilian settings and combat medical personnel face multiple additional challenges in caring for their wounded teammates in a tactical setting. They must provide care while under hostile fire, often working in the dark with multiple casualties and limited equipment. They must also often contend with prolonged evacuation times as well as the need for tactical maneuvering superimposed upon their efforts to render care. 1. H",

In the mid-1990s, a Special Operations medical research project was undertaken with the goal of improving the survivability of combat trauma injuries by improving the kind of care rendered on the battlefield. This research effort developed a new concept called Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) and proposed a set of pre-hospital trauma care guidelines that were customized for use on the battlefield. This effort was focused on the most common historical causes of preventable death in combat (see figure 1). The TCCC guidelines were quickly adopted by the Navy Sea, Air, and Land (SEAL) community, the 75th Ranger Regiment, and later by a few other military units.

With increasing reports of success from units using the techniques advocated by TCCC, this new approach to battlefield trauma care began to spread throughout the US military. The tri-service Committee on TCCC (CoTCCC) was begun in 2001 to ensure that emerging technology and information is incorporated into the TCCC guidelines on an ongoing basis. The membership of the CoTCCC includes combat medics, Corpsmen, and PJs as well as physicians and physician assistants. The Committee is a standing multi-service committee charged with monitoring medical developments in regards to practice, technology, pharmacology and doctrine.

Numerous reports published in the medical literature and collected from combat first responders have now documented that TCCC is saving lives and is improving the tactical flow of missions on which casualties have occurred. 2. PRINCIPLES OF TACTICAL COMBAT CASUALTY CARE (TCCC) a. The principles of Tactical Combat Casualty Care are fundamentally different from those of traditional civilian trauma care, where most medical providers, medics, and Corpsmen train. These differences are based on both the unique patterns and types of wounds that are suffered in combat and the tactical conditions medical personnel face in combat. Unique combat wounds and tactical conditions can make it difficult to determine which intervention to perform at what time.

Put another way, \u201cgood medicine may be a bad tactical decision,\u201d which can get the rescuer and the casualty killed. To successfully navigate these issues, medical providers must have skills and training oriented to combat trauma care, as opposed to civilian trauma care. b.

The three phases of care are: Care Under Fire, Tactical Field Care, and Tactical Evacuation Care. 3. FIRST PHASE OF TCCC a. Care Under Fire - care rendered at the scene while both the Corpsman and the casualty are still under effective hostile fire.

The need for medical care must be weighed against the need to move to cover and to suppress hostile fire rapidly. Moving a casualty to safety must only be done if it is tactically feasible. Rescuers should never move into a zeroed-in position. Fire superiority is considered the best medicine since the fewer rounds coming at your Marines, the fewer injuries they will have. b.

First, determine the potential risk to rescuers. Where is fire coming from? Is it direct or indirect? Also consider your assets. What can rescuers provide in the way of covering fire, screening, shielding, and rescue equipment (if any)? Make sure everyone understands their role in the rescue and which movement technique will be used. It is also helpful if the casualty knows the plan so they can assist as much as possible.

Chin Lift/Jaw Thrust: Basic maneuver to open airway 2. Nasopharyngeal Airway (NPA): Used for unconscious patients with intact gag reflex 3. Supraglottic Airway Device: Used when NPA is insufficient 4. Surgical Cricothyroidotomy: Used when other methods fail ## Breathing Support Ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation: 1. Needle Decompression: For tension pneumothorax 2. Chest Seal: For open pneumothorax 3. Oxygen Administration: When available 4. Assisted Ventilation: When breathing is inadequate ## Circulation Management Control bleeding and maintain circulation: 1. Direct Pressure: First-line treatment for hemorrhage 2.
