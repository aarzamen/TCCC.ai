2. Run `verify_audio_stt_e2e.py --mock --file` to test with mock STT
3. Run `verify_audio_stt_e2e.py --mock` to test with microphone
4. Run `verify_audio_stt_e2e.py --file` to test with real STT
5. Run `verify_audio_stt_e2e.py` to test full pipeline with real microphone 
6. Run `verify_audio_stt_e2e.py --cache --file --model tiny.en` to test model caching

## Completion Criteria

This plan will be considered complete when:

1. ✅ Audio pipeline reliably captures input from Razer Seiren V3 Mini
2. ✅ STT engine (faster-whisper) consistently transcribes speech
3. ✅ End-to-end verification passes with real microphone input
4. ✅ Launcher script starts the system without manual steps
5. ✅ System remains stable during extended operation (30+ minutes)
