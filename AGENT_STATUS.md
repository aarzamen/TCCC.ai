## Daily Standup

### Day 1 (2025-03-06)
- **Agent 1**: Setting up audio event processing work
- **Agent 2**: Analyzing document-LLM integration issues
- **Agent 3**: Investigating system flow failures

## Blockers & Dependencies

- System event loop needs to be fixed before comprehensive testing (Agent 3)
- Shared event format needs to be standardized (All Agents)
- Consistent error handling approach needed (All Agents)

## Next Steps

1. Fix core system event loop
2. Implement proper module initialization sequence
3. Repair event passing between components
4. Add comprehensive logging throughout the pipeline
