# TCCC Multi-Agent Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our approach to implementing system integration across the TCCC project using multiple Claude Code agents. We've identified that key components work in isolation but fail in integration, particularly related to event passing and handling between modules.

## Problem Analysis

After thorough code review, we've identified these core issues:

1. **Inconsistent method naming** between components (e.g., `get_audio()` vs `get_audio_segment()`)
2. **Missing standard event schema** for inter-component communication
3. **Format mismatches** in data passed between components
4. **Async/sync initialization conflicts** in module startup
5. **Inadequate error handling** for integration edge cases

## Multi-Agent Implementation Strategy

We're using a progressive integration approach with dedicated agents for each major component group:

### Agent 1: Audio Pipeline & STT Integration (Audio Specialist)
- **Focus**: Fix audio data flow from capture to transcription
- **Key Issue**: Audio format standardization between components
- **Files**: `audio_pipeline.py`, `stt_engine.py`
- **Implementation**: Add standardized `get_audio_segment()` with proper metadata

### Agent 2: LLM & Document Library Integration (LLM Specialist)
- **Focus**: Fix integration between NLP components
- **Key Issue**: Query format standardization and result handling
- **Files**: `llm_analysis.py`, `document_library.py`
- **Implementation**: Standardize query format and properly handle results

### Agent 3: System & Processing Core Integration (System Specialist)
- **Focus**: Fix core system event flow and initialization
- **Key Issue**: Event loop and module initialization sequence
- **Files**: `system.py`, `processing_core.py`
- **Implementation**: Create standard event schema and fix event routing

## Standard Event Schema

We've created a standardized event schema (see `TCCC_EVENT_SCHEMA.md`) that defines:

1. Base event structure with required fields
2. Specific event types for each data flow
3. Required metadata for integration
4. Error handling format

**Example Audio Segment Event**:
```json
{
  "type": "audio_segment",
  "timestamp": 1234567890.123,
  "source": "audio_pipeline",
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "data": {
    "audio": [...],
    "sample_rate": 16000,
    "format": "PCM16",
    "is_speech": true
  }
}
```

## Implementation Process

1. **Phase 1: Infrastructure** (Current)
   - Create standard event schema
   - Implement basic integration tests
   - Fix module initialization

2. **Phase 2: Component Integration** (Next)
   - Fix Audio Pipeline → STT integration
   - Fix Processing Core → LLM integration
   - Fix LLM → Document Library integration

3. **Phase 3: End-to-End Flow** (Final)
   - Connect all components
   - Implement error handling
   - Add comprehensive logging

## Verification Approach

We've implemented a progressive verification approach with focused tests:

1. **Component Verification**: Tests each module in isolation
2. **Integration Verification**: Tests pairs of connected modules
3. **End-to-End Verification**: Tests complete system flow

Custom verification scripts test specific integration points:
- `verification_script_audio_stt_integration.py`
- `verification_script_system_enhanced.py`

## Conclusion

This multi-agent approach allows us to parallelize the implementation work while ensuring consistent interfaces between components. By standardizing the event schema and focusing on specific integration points, we'll create a robust system that reliably passes data between all modules.

Our progressive integration approach ensures we build a minimal working "walking skeleton" first, then iteratively expand functionality while maintaining system stability.
