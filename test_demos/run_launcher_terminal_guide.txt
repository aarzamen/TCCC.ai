# Guide to run demo_launcher.py from terminal using default python3

# 1. Navigate to the test_demos directory:
cd /home/ama/tccc-project/test_demos

# 2. Run the launcher script using the system's default python3:
#    (This relies on inquirerpy being installed in ~/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages)
python3 demo_launcher.py

# 3. The TUI menu should appear. Select a demo to run or Ctrl+C to exit.
#    Output from the demo will be logged to a file in this directory.
