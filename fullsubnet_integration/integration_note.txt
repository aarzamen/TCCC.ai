# FullSubNet Integration Note

This is an offline/placeholder setup for the FullSubNet integration. To complete the setup:

1. When internet access is available, download the pre-trained model:
   - Visit https://github.com/Audio-WestlakeU/FullSubNet/releases/download/v1.0.0/fullsubnet_best_model_58epochs.pth
   - Save the file to: fullsubnet_integration/models/fullsubnet_best_model_58epochs.pth
   - Update the config file to point to this model

2. Install required dependencies:
   - PyTorch: pip install torch==1.12.0 torchaudio==0.12.0
   - SoundFile: pip install soundfile
   - Librosa: pip install librosa

3. Clone the FullSubNet repository:
   - git clone https://github.com/Audio-WestlakeU/FullSubNet.git fullsubnet
   - Install it with: pip install -e fullsubnet/

For now, the integration will work in offline/placeholder mode with basic audio processing.
