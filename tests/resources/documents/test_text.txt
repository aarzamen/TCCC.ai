MEDICAL ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL

This document outlines the basic protocol for medical assessment in tactical situations.

STEP 1: SCENE ASSESSMENT
- Ensure scene safety before approaching
- Identify potential threats or hazards
- Determine number of casualties
- Request additional resources if needed

STEP 2: PRIMARY ASSESSMENT (MARCH)
M - Massive Hemorrhage
- Control life-threatening external bleeding
- Apply tourniquets for limb hemorrhage
- Apply direct pressure and hemostatic agents for other sites

A - Airway
- Assess airway patency
- Clear obstructions
- Consider advanced airway if needed

R - Respiration
- Assess breathing quality and rate
- Check for tension pneumothorax
- Perform needle decompression if indicated
- Apply chest seals for open chest wounds

C - Circulation
- Check pulse (rate, quality)
- Assess skin color and temperature
- Initiate IV/IO access if needed
- Control non-life-threatening bleeding

H - Head Injury/Hypothermia
- Assess level of consciousness (AVPU)
- Check for signs of increased intracranial pressure
- Prevent/treat hypothermia

STEP 3: SECONDARY ASSESSMENT
- Detailed head-to-toe examination
- Document all findings
- Reassess vital signs every 5 minutes for unstable patients
- Prepare for evacuation

STEP 4: DOCUMENTATION
- Record all assessments, interventions and times
- Document changes in patient condition
- Complete casualty card

EVACUATION CATEGORIES:
1. Urgent (Red): Life-threatening injuries requiring immediate evacuation
2. Priority (Yellow): Serious injuries requiring evacuation within 4 hours
3. Routine (Green): Non-serious injuries that can wait for evacuation
4. Expectant (Black): Injuries too severe to survive given available resources
