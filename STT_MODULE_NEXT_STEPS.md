# STT Module Improvement Plan

## Current Status (March 6, 2025 Update)
- ✅ Successfully implemented faster-whisper integration
- ✅ Created model download and initialization framework
- ✅ Implemented platform detection and adaptation
- ✅ Added medical vocabulary integration
- ✅ Fixed VAD energy threshold initialization bug in audio pipeline
- ✅ Confirmed microphone demo works with both mock and faster-whisper engines
- ⚠️ Some issues remain with transcription output handling
- ⚠️ VAD filtering needs parameter adjustment for battlefield audio

## Recent Fixes
- ✅ Fixed VAD initialization to ensure required variables are always set
- ✅ Ensured fallback path works when WebRTC is not available
- ✅ Updated STT engine integration to handle microphone input
- ✅ Created updated documentation in STT_DEMO_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- ✅ Documented issues and solutions in stt_engine_fixes.md

## Next Implementation Steps

### 1. Audio Quality Enhancement
- Implement battlefield noise cancellation
- Add adaptive gain control for varying distances
- Optimize voice activity detection parameters for battlefield conditions

### 2. Medical Vocabulary Integration
- Integrate TCCC medical terminology
- Add specialized military/tactical terminology
- Implement context-aware terminology correction

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Fix tensor optimization warning (torch variable reference issue)
- Quantize model for Jetson hardware
- Implement streaming transcription for real-time feedback
- Add dynamic quality settings based on available resources

### 4. Testing Framework
- Create automated testing with sample battlefield audio
- Develop WER (Word Error Rate) measurement for medical terms
- Implement continuous quality monitoring

## Technical Debt To Address
- ✅ `mock_stt.py` now matches interface with real implementation
- ✅ Fixed model loading paths to be configurable
- ✅ Added proper shutdown method for resource cleanup
- ✅ Fixed VAD energy threshold initialization bug in audio pipeline
- ⚠️ Need to fix transcribe_segment method to handle results correctly
- ⚠️ Fix tensor optimization issue with torch variable reference
- ⚠️ Need to create configuration file for Jetson optimizer

## Dependencies
- ✅ Faster Whisper library (installed)
- ✅ PyAudio for audio capture (installed)
- ✅ onnxruntime for model inference (installed)
- ⚠️ TensorRT for model optimization on Jetson (available only on Jetson hardware)
- ⚠️ CUDA libraries for GPU acceleration (available only on GPU systems)

## Installation Instructions
To set up the STT model:
1. Run `python setup_stt_model.py` to create directory structure
2. Run `python download_stt_model.py --model-size tiny.en` to download tiny model
3. Run `python download_silero_vad.py` to download VAD model files
4. Verify with `python test_faster_whisper.py` to test model loading
5. Run `python verification_script_stt_engine.py --engine faster-whisper` for full test

## Running the Microphone Demo
To demonstrate the STT functionality with a microphone:
1. Ensure your microphone is connected and working
2. Run `python demo_stt_microphone.py --list-microphones` to identify your device
3. Run `python demo_stt_microphone.py --engine mock --device 0` for quick testing with predefined phrases
4. Run `python demo_stt_microphone.py --engine faster-whisper --device 0` for actual speech recognition
5. Use Ctrl+C to stop the demo

## Known Issues
1. Tensor optimization warnings (non-critical): "Error applying tensor optimizations: local variable 'torch' referenced before assignment"
2. ALSA warnings during microphone initialization (common system messages, not affecting functionality)
