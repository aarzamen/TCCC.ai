# TCCC Display Module Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the display module enhancements for the TCCC project. The display module handles visualization of medical data, transcriptions, significant events, and the TCCC casualty card. The enhancements focus on improved performance, better visualization, and more robust hardware compatibility.

  - Theme management with three theme options (default, high-contrast, night-mode)
  - Performance tuning with FPS limiting for different hardware

### Vital Signs Visualization
- **File**: `src/tccc/display/visualization/vital_signs.py`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time visualization of vital signs (HR, BP, RR, SpO2, Temp)
  - Normal ranges and critical thresholds with color coding
  - Trend visualization with historical data
  - Compact and detailed viewing modes
  - Support for parsing vital signs from text
  - Animated transitions and dynamic updates

### Timeline Visualization
- **File**: `src/tccc/display/visualization/timeline.py`
- **Features**:
  - Chronological display of medical events with timestamps
  - Event categorization (critical, treatment, assessment, vitals, etc.)
  - Color-coded events with severity indicators
  - Interactive selection of events for details
  - Filtering by event type
  - Compact and full viewing modes
  - Pagination for large numbers of events
  - Animated transitions for new events

### Enhanced Display Demo
- **File**: `tccc_enhanced_display_demo.py`
- **Features**:
  - Complete demo integrating all visualization components
  - Demo scenario with realistic medical data and progressive timeline
  - Interactive UI with keyboard shortcuts
  - Real-time updated visualizations for vital signs and timeline
  - Integration between vital signs and timeline events
  - Support for both fullscreen and windowed modes
  - Random data generation for testing and demonstration
  - Optimized performance on Jetson hardware

### Launcher and Verification
- **Files**: 
  - `run_enhanced_display_demo.sh` - Demo launcher script
  - `TCCC_Enhanced_Display.desktop` - Desktop shortcut
  - `verification_script_display_enhanced.py` - Verification script

## Testing and Verification
The enhanced display module has been tested with the following criteria:

1. **Performance testing**:
   - Maintains stable frame rate (>30 FPS) on Jetson hardware
   - Responsive UI with minimal latency
   - Memory usage optimization

2. **Compatibility testing**:
   - Works with WaveShare display (1280x720)
   - Compatible with standard HDMI displays
   - Fallback modes for headless operation

3. **Functional testing**:
   - Correct display of transcriptions and events
   - Accurate vital signs visualization
   - Proper card data formatting and display

## Future Work
The following components have been planned for future implementation:

1. **Additional visualizations**:
   - Injury location visualization - graphical representation of injury locations and severity
   - Complete medical charts library - standardized medical chart formats
   - 3D anatomical models for precise injury marking

2. **Theme enhancements**:
   - Further refinement of night mode for low-light conditions
   - Additional high-contrast theme options for direct sunlight

3. **Rendering optimizations**:
   - Partial screen updates for improved performance
   - Additional Jetson-specific hardware acceleration
   - Vulkan/OpenGL-based rendering for complex visualizations

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Display Demo
```bash
# Run with default settings (windowed mode)
./run_enhanced_display_demo.sh

# Run in fullscreen mode
./run_enhanced_display_demo.sh --fullscreen

# Run specific demo mode
./run_enhanced_display_demo.sh --demo vitals
```

### Keyboard Controls
- `ESC` - Exit demo
- `TAB` - Toggle between live view and TCCC card view
- `V` - Toggle compact mode for vital signs
- `T` - Toggle compact mode for timeline 
- `E` - Generate test medical event (useful for demonstrations)
- `1-5` - Select active vital sign (HR, BP, RR, SpO2, Temp)
- Mouse click on timeline events to select/view details

### Verification
```bash
# Run display verification
python verification_script_display_enhanced.py
```

## Integration with Other Modules
The display module integrates with other TCCC components through the following interfaces:

1. **STT Engine** → Display: Transcription updates
2. **LLM Analysis** → Display: Significant event notifications and entity extraction
3. **Form Generator** → Display: TCCC card data updates
