# TCCC.ai Implementation Status

This document provides the current implementation status of key TCCC.ai components.

## Critical Flow Issues To Fix

1. **Async/Sync Interface Mismatches** (FIXED âœ…)
   - Added unified approach to handle both sync and async functions
   - Created proper async interfaces in module_adapter.py
   - Redesigned audio processing thread to use dedicated async event loop
   - Added utilities to automatically wrap sync methods in async-compatible functions
   - Verification script completed successfully: `verification_script_async_modules.py`

2. **Audio Pipeline Data Type Mismatches**
   - Inconsistent audio data structures between components
   - Silent failures producing None values that propagate through system
   - Fix: Add robust type checking and format conversion

3. **Event Schema Field Mismatch**
   - Inconsistencies between standard event schema and module implementations
   - Events may be dropped or misinterpreted
   - Fix: Enforce schema validation for all events

4. **Configuration Loading Inconsistencies**
   - Dual configuration systems causing incompatible configurations
   - Fix: Standardize on single configuration system

5. **Unhandled Exception Flows**
   - Exceptions in event handlers don't properly propagate to error events
   - Silent pipeline breaks without proper recovery
   - Fix: Implement consistent error handling patterns

6. **Other Issues**
   - Missing event type handling
   - Model loading race conditions
   - Inconsistent error return values
   - Audio buffer overflows
   - Insufficient session ID propagation

## Fully Implemented Components

### Audio Pipeline and Speech-to-Text
- **Real Whisper Model**: Using faster-whisper implementation, NOT a mock/dummy model
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Optimized for Jetson Orin Nano with INT8 quantization
- **Speech Enhancement**: Battlefield noise reduction verified and functional
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Detecting speech segments in noisy environments
- **Medical Vocabulary**: Custom medical terminology for improved recognition accuracy
- **Microphone Input**: Working with Razer Seiren V3 Mini microphone
- **Audio Chunk Management**: Efficient handling of variable-sized audio chunks with format conversion
- **Real-time Audio Processing**: Buffer management for continuous streaming audio

### Verification Status
- Audio Pipeline: **PASSED** - Handles real-time audio input and processing
- STT Engine: **PASSED** - Transcribes speech with faster-whisper model
- Full Pipeline: **WORKING** - Complete pipeline from microphone to transcription
