# Agent 3: Processing Core & System Integration Tasks

## Current Status
- Processing Core: ðŸŸ¡ Needs Integration
- System: ðŸ”´ Failing
- Integration Point: STT â†’ Processing Core: ðŸ”´ Failing
- Integration Point: Processing Core â†’ LLM: ðŸ”´ Failing  

## Objectives
Fix the core system flow and event handling to enable proper integration between all components. This is the central integration task that will connect the work of Agents 1 and 2.

## Tasks

### 1. Fix Core System Event Loop
- Review and fix the event processing loop in system.py
- Standardize event handling across all module interfaces
- Implement robust error recovery for the event pipeline
- Create a consistent event schema for the entire system

### 2. Implement Module Initialization Sequence
- Fix the async/sync initialization conflicts
- Ensure proper module dependency handling
- Create a robust startup sequence that validates each component

### 3. Repair Event Passing Between Components
- Fix STT â†’ Processing Core event format
- Fix Processing Core â†’ LLM event format
- Standardize event handling across all components
- Implement proper error handling for malformed events

### 4. Add Comprehensive Logging
- Add detailed logging for event flow tracking
- Implement diagnostic logging for troubleshooting
- Create performance logging to identify bottlenecks

## Standard Event Schema Definition
We need to standardize the event format across all components:

```python
# Base Event Schema
{
    "type": "event_type",          # Required: event type identifier
    "timestamp": 1234567890.123,   # Required: event creation time
    "source": "component_name",    # Required: source component
    "data": { ... },               # Required: event-specific data
    "metadata": { ... },           # Optional: additional metadata
    "session_id": "abc123",        # Optional: session identifier
    "sequence": 42                 # Optional: sequence number
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Processing Core Updates
- Fix `process()` method to handle standardized inputs
- Update entity and intent extraction to follow schema
- Implement proper error handling and recovery
- Add diagnostic logging for troubleshooting

### System Integration Updates
- Fix async initialization sequence
- Standardize module interface handling
- Update event processing pipeline
- Implement proper event routing

## Success Criteria
- System can be initialized end-to-end
- Audio data flows through the complete pipeline
- Events are properly processed by each component
- System verification script passes all tests
- End-to-end verification completes successfully

## Verification Plan
1. Test system initialization sequence
2. Verify event passing between all components
3. Test error handling and recovery
4. Run full end-to-end system verification

## Dependencies
- Requires Agent 1's work on Audio Pipeline â†’ STT integration
- Requires Agent 2's work on LLM â†’ Document Library integration
