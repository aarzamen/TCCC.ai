# TCCC System Integration Tasks

## Overview
This document outlines the system integration tasks for the TCCC project, to be tackled by the Treesome Code Crew (multi-agent collaboration).

## Current Status
- All individual components pass verification
- System integration tests fail due to:
  - Data flow issues
  - Performance verification
  - Security verification
  - Event processing

## Task Allocation

### Agent 1 (Audio & Speech Specialist)
1. **Event Processing Pipeline**
   - Fix event handling in audio pipeline
   - Ensure audio segments are properly passed to STT engine
   - Implement proper audio buffering for continuous processing
   - Add diagnostics for audio flow monitoring

2. **Real-time Processing**
   - Optimize streaming audio pipeline
   - Reduce latency in transcription processing
   - Implement threading for parallel audio processing
   - Create event monitoring for audio pipeline

### Agent 2 (LLM & Document Specialist)
1. **Document-LLM Integration**
   - Fix data flow between document retrieval and LLM analysis
   - Optimize context management for efficient processing
   - Implement query caching for performance improvement
   - Add proper error handling for retrieval failures

2. **Result Processing**
   - Fix result handling from LLM to downstream components
   - Implement standardized output format for system integration
   - Add metadata processing for traceability
   - Create logging for result quality analysis

### Agent 3 (System Integration Specialist)
1. **Core System Flow**
   - Fix main event loop in system.py
   - Implement proper module initialization sequence
   - Add dependency management to prevent startup race conditions
   - Create system-wide diagnostics

2. **Security Implementation**
   - Implement security verification tests
   - Add input validation throughout the pipeline
   - Create proper error boundaries between components
   - Add permission checks for external resources

## Integration Points

### Event Processing Flow
```
Audio Pipeline → STT Engine → Processing Core → LLM Analysis → Document Library → Results
```

### Security Boundaries
```
External Input → Validation Layer → Core Processing → Output Sanitization → External Output
```

### Performance Monitoring
```
Resource Monitor → Performance Metrics → Throttling Controls → Adaptive Processing
```

## Success Criteria
1. All system verification tests pass, including:
   - Data flow verification
   - Performance verification
   - Security verification
2. System can process end-to-end events in real-time
3. Components maintain isolation while communicating effectively
4. Resource usage stays within target limits for Jetson deployment

## Implementation Timeline
1. Day 1: Fix core system flow and event processing
2. Day 2: Implement performance optimization and monitoring
3. Day 3: Add security verification and validation
4. Day 4: Comprehensive system testing and refinement
