# Claude Code CLI Integration for TCCC.ai

This document explains how to effectively use the Claude Code CLI with the TCCC.ai project using the provided resources.

## Getting Started

The following resources are available to streamline your interactions with Claude Code CLI:

- **CLOUDCODE.md**: A comprehensive, modular reference document for Claude
- **CLOUDCODE_SNIPPETS.txt**: Ready-to-use terminal snippets for common tasks

## Using CLOUDCODE.md

The CLOUDCODE.md document is designed to be used selectively for each Claude Code session. Follow these steps:

1. **Identify your current task** (e.g., implementing a feature in the Audio Pipeline module)
2. **Include relevant sections** from CLOUDCODE.md in your Claude prompt:
   - ALWAYS include Core sections: Project Context, Development Environment, Claude Code CLI Workflow
   - ONLY include Module sections relevant to your current task
   - Include Reference sections only when needed for specific features

### Section Types in CLOUDCODE.md

- **[CORE]**: Essential project context - always include these
- **[MODULE]**: Module-specific information - include only for relevant modules
- **[WORKFLOW]**: Development workflow guidance - include when performing specific processes
- **[REFERENCE]**: Technical reference information - include when implementing specific features
- **[META]**: Document maintenance information - typically not needed for development tasks

### Example Session Preparation

For implementing a feature in the Audio Pipeline:

```bash
# Copy sections to your clipboard
cat CLOUDCODE.md | grep -A 50 "Project Context \[CORE\]" | pbcopy
# (Paste into Claude)

cat CLOUDCODE.md | grep -A 50 "Development Environment \[CORE\]" | pbcopy
# (Paste into Claude)

cat CLOUDCODE.md | grep -A 50 "Claude Code CLI Workflow \[CORE\]" | pbcopy
# (Paste into Claude)

cat CLOUDCODE.md | grep -A 50 "Audio Pipeline Module \[MODULE\]" | pbcopy
# (Paste into Claude)
```

Then, follow with your specific implementation request.

## Using Terminal Snippets

The CLOUDCODE_SNIPPETS.txt file contains ready-to-use prompts for common development tasks:

1. **Copy the relevant snippet** from CLOUDCODE_SNIPPETS.txt
2. **Fill in the placeholder values** with your specific details
3. **Paste into your terminal** with Claude Code CLI

### Available Snippets

1. Implement Module Function
2. Debug Module Issue
3. Optimize Performance
4. Generate Unit Tests
5. Architecture Review (CRITICAL)
6. Module Integration
7. Document Component
8. Optimize Memory Usage
9. Fix Race Condition
10. Implement Feature

### Example Snippet Usage

```bash
# Copy a snippet
cat CLOUDCODE_SNIPPETS.txt | grep -A 20 "1. Implement Module Function" | pbcopy

# Edit the placeholder values in your editor
vim /tmp/my_prompt.txt

# Send to Claude Code CLI
cat /tmp/my_prompt.txt | claude
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Context**: Always provide sufficient context for Claude by including relevant CLOUDCODE.md sections
2. **Be Specific**: Replace all placeholders in snippets with detailed information
3. **Use Modular Approach**: Only include sections relevant to your current task
4. **Maintain Common Patterns**: Follow the project's established patterns when requesting implementations
5. **Reference Existing Code**: Include examples of similar functionality from the codebase
6. **Use /compact**: When conversations get long, use the `/compact` command to optimize context
7. **Update CLOUDCODE.md**: When project evolves, update the documentation to maintain accuracy

## Context Window Optimization

To maximize Claude's context window usage:

1. **Include Only Necessary Sections**: Be selective about which sections to include
2. **Use Progressive Detail**: Start with high-level requests, add details iteratively
3. **Reference File Paths**: Instead of pasting large files, reference paths when possible
4. **Use Session Management**: For complex tasks spanning multiple sessions, summarize progress

## Updating the CloudCode Framework

As the project evolves:

1. Update CLOUDCODE.md with new modules or changed interfaces
2. Refine snippets based on common usage patterns
3. Add new reference sections for additional technologies
4. Maintain the modular structure for efficient context management

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Claude Code CLI:

1. **Context Window Limitations**: If Claude seems to miss information, you may be exceeding the context window. Use `/compact` or reduce the included sections.
2. **Unclear Responses**: Ensure your prompts include specific interface details and requirements.
3. **Inconsistent Code**: Check that you've included relevant module sections with implementation considerations.
4. **Performance Issues**: Make sure to include hardware constraints and performance targets in your requests.
