# Implement Processing Core Module Requirements

## Summary
- Implemented SQLite with WAL mode for state persistence, replacing JSON storage
- Added module registration system with networkx-based dependency tracking
- Enhanced error handling with state transitions and recovery mechanisms
- Integrated resource monitoring with thermal management for Jetson hardware
- Implemented dynamic resource allocation based on system load

## Changes
- Added module registration system that validates dependencies
- Implemented operational states with well-defined transitions (UNINITIALIZEDâ†’INITIALIZINGâ†’READYâ†’ACTIVEâ†”STANDBYâ†’SHUTDOWN)
- Enhanced logging system with size-based and time-based log rotation
- Added comprehensive error handling with recovery paths
- Added verification script for manual testing key components

## Test Plan
- Run unit tests: `pytest tests/processing_core tests/utils/test_logging.py`
- Run verification script: `python verification_script.py`
- Verify SQLite persistence: Check that module state is preserved across restarts
- Test dynamic resource allocation under load
