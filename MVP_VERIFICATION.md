# TCCC MVP Verification Guide

This document outlines the verification strategy for ensuring the TCCC MVP is complete and functional. It focuses on verifying that existing functionality works reliably rather than adding new features.

## Verification Strategy

The verification strategy follows these principles:

1. **Focus on Core Functionality**: Ensure all critical components work as expected
2. **End-to-End Testing**: Verify components work together correctly
3. **Clear Success Criteria**: Define what "working" means for each component
4. **Systematic Bug Tracking**: Prioritize fixing critical bugs that block functionality

## MVP Components

The core MVP components that need verification are:

1. **Audio Pipeline**: Audio capture and processing
2. **STT Engine**: Speech-to-text functionality
3. **Event System**: Event distribution between components
4. **Display Components**: Visualization of data (timeline and vital signs)
5. **RAG System**: Document retrieval and context generation

## Verification Process

### 1. Individual Component Verification

Each component is verified individually using dedicated verification scripts:

- **Audio Pipeline**: `verification_script_audio_pipeline.py`
- **STT Engine**: `verification_script_stt_engine.py`
- **Event System**: `verification_script_event_schema.py`
- **Display Components**: `verification_script_display_enhanced.py`
- **RAG System**: `verification_script_rag.py`

### 2. Integration Verification

Integration points between components are verified using:

- **Audio → STT**: `verify_audio_stt_e2e.py`
- **Display ↔ Event System**: `verification_script_display_integration.py`

### 3. End-to-End Verification

The complete system is verified using:

- **Comprehensive Verification**: `verify_tccc_system.py --mvp`

## Running the Verification

To run the complete MVP verification:

```bash
./verify_tccc_system.py --mvp
```

This will:
1. Check all core components
2. Verify integration points
3. Ensure end-to-end functionality
4. Generate a verification report

## Verification Results

The verification script generates a report in `verification_status.txt` with the following sections:

1. **Core Components**: Status of each individual component
2. **Integration Points**: Status of component integrations
3. **Overall Status**: Whether the MVP meets all requirements

## Bug Prioritization

When fixing issues, follow this priority order:

1. **Critical Bugs**: Issues that prevent core functionality from working
2. **Integration Bugs**: Issues with component communication
3. **Performance Issues**: Problems that affect usability
4. **Non-essential Bugs**: Issues with optional features

## Test Scenarios

The verification focuses on these key scenarios:

1. **Audio Capture → Transcription**: Verify audio is captured and correctly transcribed
2. **Event Distribution**: Verify events flow correctly between components
3. **Display Visualization**: Verify timeline and vital signs are rendered correctly
4. **System Integration**: Verify all components work together as expected

## Next Steps After Verification

Once verification passes:

1. Perform a final manual review of the system
2. Ensure all launcher scripts and desktop shortcuts work
3. Create a backup of the working MVP state
4. Prepare user documentation for basic operation

## Conclusion

This verification approach ensures the TCCC MVP delivers its core promise: a working, integrated system that captures audio, performs transcription, processes that information, and displays it effectively. It prioritizes functionality over features, focusing on creating a solid foundation upon which additional capabilities can be built.
